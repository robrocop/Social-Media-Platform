# Social-Media-Platform
This was an assignment that I completed for my Software Tools and System Programming class. I had to write a server which allowed clients to connect and issue various social media realted commands (list all the users, make two people friends, view a specific person's profile and send a message to someone). I did not have to write a client as this was provided to us.
